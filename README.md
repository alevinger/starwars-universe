How to use the downloaded files

    Run "npm install" in the extracted folder
    Run "npm start" to view the project




    The goal:

    Create a small React application that shows all the planets in the StarWars universe. When we click on a planet, we are able to see more detailed information about that planet (for example: name, population, size, etc.). There is no design brief, so be creative.

    

    Technical details:

    We would like you to create a React application using Facebookâ€™s create-react-app: https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/. This gives you all the boilerplate code you need to get started. To get all the data for the application you can use https://swapi.co. This website provide a free to use, public REST API, with all kinds of nice data around the StarWars universe. For this task we will be using the â€˜Planetsâ€™ API: https://swapi.co/documentation#planets. You can load the data using AJAX, fetch or any other method you prefer. The REST API is pretty simple:

        To get a list of all the planets, just load: https://swapi.co/api/planets/
        To get more information about one planet just load: https://swapi.co/api/planets/1/



    You are free to use any additional libraries you need to complete the task.

    We expect that this exercise will not take more than 3 hours.



    Bonusses:

        Creating a user interface that is more than just a table / list with planets, but something more visual ðŸ˜Š
        Clean, readable and formatted code.
        Clear variable and function names.
        Adding animations or transitions.
